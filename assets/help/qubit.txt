=== Qubit Tactic ===
The qubit tactic provides useful suggestions for `~` expressions.

For example:

  ~a
  ((a = b) ^ ⊤)

The qubit tactic will suggest the following:

  Suggestions:
  0. ~b by qubit

The `~` operator has congruence by tautological identity only.
This means, that in order to substitute in the argument,
one requires `a = b` to be provable from `⊤`.
This is expressed as the exponential `((a = b) ^ ⊤)`.
