=== Help Tactic ===
A tactic is a user assistant that helps with theorem proving.

To add a new tactic, use the following syntax:

  use <tactic>

When a tactic is no longer needed, it can be removed with

  rem <tactic>

You will be notified when new expressions are suggested.
Each suggested expression will have an associated number.
Type the number to add it to the list of expressions.
